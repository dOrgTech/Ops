# Researching DORG Token Incentives

**Author(s)**: Remscar (Zachary Nawar)

## Summary

It's currently not possible to do anything with `DORG` tokens that builders may have, therefore builders who choose to take payment in the form of `DORG` tokens should be rewarded additional reputation.

This proposal is to research and determine the best way to additionally reward dOrg `REP` tokens to builders who choose to receive payment in `DORG` tokens.

## Background

Currently builders can choose to receive some of their payment in a `DORG` token.
The `DORG` token is currently valued 1:1 with DAI, but cannot be used.
As such the `DORG` token represents an investment of payment back into dOrg with no defined APY (annual percentage yield.)

Currently 1 `REP` token is awarded for every 1 `DORG` token a builder receives as payment.

## Why should we fund this?

Builders at dOrg are choosing to invest their hard earned money back into the internal development and growth of dOrg by receiving `DORG` tokens in place of `DAI` and should be rewarded for these actions.

Since there is no utility, way to redeem, or way to earn additional returns on `DORG` tokens, currently, the builders who receive `DORG` tokens are for all intents and purposes giving their money to dOrg.

## Outcomes

There are a few outcomes of this DSP.

### Research

Research and explore this statement:

> Whenever a builder chooses to receive payment in `DORG` tokens, they should receive an additional amount of `REP` tokens. How much should they receive and in what ways can dOrg leverage this additional reward to raise funds while still maintaining it's organizational values.

The exact amount of additional rep a builder should receive needs to be carefully thought out and could change over time.

### Interview

Interview peers at dOrg both during and after the research process to explore ideas, discuss findings, and better understand what might be the best for dOrg.

### Sharing

A session will be held to share findings with dOrg.

### DSP

Based on the research findings, and permitting that this is a good idea, another DSP will be put forth to implement a fair incentive.
