# Proposal Title

**Author(s)**: [@benefacto](https://github.com/benefacto)

## Summary

This proposal is to partially subsidize the total cost of shared lodging born out-of-pocket by builders who would need the subsidy in order to attend a 2021 dOrg retreat in Spain.
For example, a single venue (such as a large AirBnb, [example](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/28388357?adults=16&check_in=2021-09-12&check_out=2021-09-18&federated_search_id=68aec4c4-69a2-4a1b-bb22-b739cfea7a73&source_impression_id=p3_1621874498_Ai1S%2B80nufubXIPx&guests=1)) could be selected that could lodge as many dOrg builders as possible and dOrg would provide a a fixed subsidy for this venue.
Selecting a single venue for those who need the subsidy would be the most cost effective and ensure that builders' out-of-pocket lodging expenses are minimized. 
This venue could also serve as a central gathering and/or meeting place for all dOrg builders that are attending the retreat.
All remaining costs would be born out-of-pocket by the builders who chose to lodge themselves at that venue.

## Why should we fund this?

Since most dOrg builders work entirely remotely, the opportunity to interact in person is often rare and reliant on individual builders to pursue.
There are numerous benefits ([examples](https://www.fastcompany.com/3051518/the-science-of-when-you-need-in-person-communication)) that in-person communication can have on organizations and it is in dOrg's interest to, within its limited means, support these efforts. These benefits will not be fully covered in the scoped of this proposal.
As per [this Discord poll](https://discord.com/channels/544647726982365194/841482176667189248/844710106888536064), about 37% of active dOrg builders signalled their interest in attending a dOrg retreat.
In the same poll, most dOrg builders preferred that dOrg partially or fully bear the costs of a dOrg retreat and in [a separate poll](https://discord.com/channels/544647726982365194/841482176667189248/844985976278614047), most preferred this retreat to take place in Spain.
While fully covering the costs of such a retreat does not seem realistic at this time (see dOrg's reserve [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mwYhzTNXSytzVtACZLu1V_EVTfjPKhGfHu-KhnBFESk/edit#gid=846347915)), a modest subsidy to limit the costs born by dOrg builders seems in line with the desires signaled in these polls.


## Anything else you'd like to add?

The subsidy will provide partial reimbursement for (the) builder(s) who bear the off-chain costs of this shared lodging.
