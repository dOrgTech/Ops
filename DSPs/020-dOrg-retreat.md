# 2021 dOrg Retreat

| Budget | Term | Leads (hr/wk ) | Builders (hr/wk) |
|-|-|-|-|
| 1,000 DAI + 250 DORG | 1 Weeks (September 26 - October 2, 2021) | Ben (TBD), Hector (TBD) | TBD |

## Summary

This proposal is to provide, at least partial, reimbursement for the expense of group teambuilding activities born out-of-pocket by builders for 2021 dOrg retreat in Barcelona, Spain as well as coordination of those activites.
All remaining costs (travel, lodging, etc.) would be born out-of-pocket by the builders themselves.

## Why should we fund this?

Since most dOrg builders work entirely remotely, the opportunity to interact in person is often rare and reliant on individual builders to pursue.
There are numerous benefits ([examples](https://www.fastcompany.com/3051518/the-science-of-when-you-need-in-person-communication)) that in-person communication can have on organizations and it is in dOrg's interest to, within its limited means, support these efforts. These benefits will not be fully covered in the scoped of this proposal.
As per [this Discord poll](https://discord.com/channels/544647726982365194/841482176667189248/844710106888536064), about 37% of active dOrg builders signalled their interest in attending a dOrg retreat.
In the same poll, most dOrg builders preferred that dOrg partially or fully bear the costs of a dOrg retreat and in [a separate poll](https://discord.com/channels/544647726982365194/841482176667189248/844985976278614047), most preferred this retreat to take place in Spain.
While fully covering the costs of such a retreat does not seem realistic at this time (see dOrg's reserve [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mwYhzTNXSytzVtACZLu1V_EVTfjPKhGfHu-KhnBFESk/edit#gid=846347915)), a modest subsidy to limit the costs born by dOrg builders seems in line with the desires signaled in these polls.


## Anything else you'd like to add?

The subsidy will provide partial reimbursement for (the) builder(s) who bear the off-chain costs of group teambuilding activities as well as coordination of those activities.
