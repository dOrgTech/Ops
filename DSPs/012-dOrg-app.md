# app.dOrg

## Summary

It's no secret that there are inefficiencies within our internal processes. And while we are making a concerted effort to reveal and address these, our current smorgasboard of internal apps and software makes it difficult for us to resolve some of these inefficiencies. Furthermore, some of these apps have functional limitations and underlying UX inefficiencies that we are currently handcuffed to.

To give a little more context, some of these issues include:
- Inability to edit or redact an existing proposal
- Inability to make batched payments
- Making a new proposal is unintuitive
- Cumbersome google sheets which make budgeting/operations difficult to manage
- Proposal-specific communication is difficult
- Lack of async notifications for DAO activity and project updates/requests


## Why should we fund this?

The problems outlined above create enormous amounts of overhead in our day-to-day by making things unnecessarily difficult to understand, and they increase the risk of mistakes and fraudulent proposals.

Creating a specialized dOrg app that we own, build, and iterate on gives us full control of customizing and optimizing our systems and procedures to fit dOrg's specific and fluid needs, while also increasing our security standards.

On top of this, the end product is something that can be forked, and will also further establish our expertise in the DAO ecosystem.

## Timeline

12 Weeks (Mar 22 - Jun 14)

- **Design Strategy:** Est. 4 weeks (~10 hr/wk)
    - Discovery (1 week)
    - Ideation and Refinement (1 week)

    - Fat marker sketches/wireframes (1.5 weeks)
- **Product Development:** Est. 8 weeks (~12 hr/wk)
    - Basic style and components
    - Mock-ups - not for every page, but enough to flesh out some of the more complex UI
    - Static site without web3 integrations
    - I can handle most of the frontend development myself, but will probably need somewhere around 2-3hrs of development mentorship/support per week during this phase.

- **Feedback & Advisory** Ongoing (~1 hr/wk)
    - Internal feedback and advice
