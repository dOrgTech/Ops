# Quality Assurance Upgrade

Building on our success from the [Quality Engagement DSP](https://github.com/dOrgTech/Ops/blob/master/DSPs/006-Onboarding-%26-Engagement.md), which focused on improving the recruitment and onboarding experience, the next period will focus on designing a set of quality assurance practices to integrate into the lifecycle of every client project.

## Why should we fund this?

Now that we have a growing community of quality builders, our biggest bottleneck to sustainable growth is the quality of our work. By optimizing the Quality Assurance process across all dOrg projects, we can greatly improve our retention, as well as client and builder happiness.

These processes will allow our teams to consistently achieve a high quality of work and internalize new lessons, fueling reflexive, iterative & cohesive growth across the entire DAO.

## Anything else you'd like to add?

Our primary focus will be to improve and standardize the...

* Project initiation process
  - Screening clients & scoping technical requirements
  - Drafting an SoW
  - Forming a team
  - Approving the project
* Project management practices
  - Setting expectations & resolving difficult situations
  - Ongoing QA processes
  - Client invoicing & builder outvoicing
  - Client & builder feedback flows

At a high-level we intend for this workstream to cover the remaining elements in the quality engagement roadmap:
- [x] Builder recruiting (outreach, activation, onboarding)
- [ ] Client sourcing (screening, scoping, team formation, closing)
- [ ] Client happinness (quality assurance, invoicing)
- [ ] Builder happinness (upskilling, flex time, outvoicing)
