# Proposal Title

**Author(s)**: [@benefacto](https://github.com/benefacto)

## Summary

A code of ethics is a long standing need for dOrg (see [#9](https://github.com/dOrgTech/Ops/issues/9)) that has become readily apparent due to recent operational challenges.

## Why should we fund this?

A code of ethics for dOrg will explicitly define the expected/avoided behavior of dOrg's builders as well as enforcement mechanisms, matching the interests of dOrg as a whole.
This will reduce business and legal risk to dOrg, ensuring that its builder lifecycle can continue to scale with its growing capacity.
