# dOrg Code of Ethics

To ensure that dOrg remains an exceptional place to work and a valuable service provider to our clients & partners, we must hold ourselves to high ethical standards such as those outlined here.

## Avoided Behaviors
The following behaviors should be avoided:

* Accepting work from dOrg clients/partners independently without paying a referral fee (20%) to dOrg for sourcing said work
* Deletion or malicious alteration of communications/comments/messages on dOrg channels except, in cases, where ethical violations have occurred and such action has been approved by dOrg moderators
* Engagement in abuse, discrimination, disrespect, harassment, or promotion of said or otherwise offensive content against/to any prospective/past/current dOrg client/partner/builder
* Exertion of personal copyright over any work prepared for, paid for by, or otherwise commissioned by dOrg, or any past/current dOrg client/partner
* Obstruction of dOrg operations through 'down staking' of DAO proposals except, in cases, where the proposer has admitted that a wish to rescind their proposal and/or a significant enough margin of voters have expressed a wish to change their votes such that the outcome (passing or failing) of the proposal would be otherwise changed
* Participation in any strike, slowdown, sabotage, or work stoppage in retaliation for the action(s) or inaction of any prospective/past/current dOrg client/partner/builder
* Public defamation of any prospective/past/current dOrg client/partner/builder without prior authorization and/or through unofficial channels
* Sharing documents, code, media, or other dOrg materials explicitly marked as internal, confidential, or private
* Sharing any client/partner materials without prior authorization of the client/partner


## Enforcement
dOrg follows the principle of restorative justice when avoided behaviors occur but builds in certain safeguards to protect the collective as a whole.

1. When an avoided behavior seems to have occured, the offender(s) should first be contacted directly in order to reach an accord. Perhaps, the offender(s) made (a) mistake(s) and are/is prepared to immediately rectify it themselves. 
2. If this is not possible, those affected should contact dOrg moderators to mitigate any immediate damage that may have occured and schedule a mediation between the victim(s) & the offender(s). A mutually agreeable mediator could be selected, with consensus of the victim(s) and the offender(s), and can be any builder within dOrg. If there is no consensus, a dOrg moderator should act as a stopgap. A mediation should include sharing experiences of what happened, discusssion of who was harmed by the behavior and how, the creation of a consensus for what the offender(s) can do to repair the harm from the offense(s), and the enaction of said consensus.
3. If a mediation is successful, then the DAO should pass a 'censure' proposal of the offender(s) which includes a record (private to dOrg members) of the mediation to be reviewed if/when future offense(s) occur. After 'censure' proposals pass or fail, the offender(s) are/is considered to be then in good standing with dOrg and no further action is neccesary.
4. If a mediation is unsuccessful, then the DAO should weigh the severity of the offense(s) and decide whether deactivation or partial Rep slashing of the offender(s) is warranted.

### Partial Rep Slashing
Partial rep slashing is a reasonable consequence for minor offenses where mediation has failed but the offender is believed to have a sincere desire to abide by dOrg's Code of Ethics.
To slash a builder's rep, a 'censure' proposal must be passed which also includes an amount of Rep to be slashed and an explanation of why this amount is appropriate.

### Deactivation

To deactivate a builder, a 'deactivation' proposal may be made by any builder and must be passed which includes a record (private to dOrg members) of the offenses that occured and why deactivation is warranted.
This proposal should be evaluated by the DAO based on whether the enforcement processes outlined in the Code of Ethics were followed and whether the enforcement option selected is proportionate.
dOrg moderators may decide whether to remove the offender(s) from internal spaces before, during, or after such a proposal passes, depending on the risk they anticipate to dOrg.
If a deactivation proposal fails, the member is considered to be then in good standing with dOrg, regains any access to internal spaces they may have lost, and no further action is neccesary.

#### Suspension
Suspension is reserved for offenders who are, at least, partially remorseful of their offense(s) but not yet ready for successful mediation and/or to abide by dOrg's Code of Ethics.
Suspension proposals should include a minimum suspension period proportionate to the offense, after which the offender may attempt another [activation project](../../activation.md) with dOrg.
This activation project should also include acknowledgement by the offender of their wrongdoing, a formal apology, and a proposal on how to repair the harm from the offense(s).
Suspended members forfeit all Rep at the time of suspension but are eligible to regain it upon reactivation.

#### Expulsion
Expulsion is for offenders that dOrg believes to be incorrigible violators of its Code of Ethics.
Expelled builders are not eligible to activate with dOrg again.
They forfeit all Rep at the time of expulsion and are ineligible to regain it.
