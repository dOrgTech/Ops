# Deactivation

Builders can continuously flow in and out of dOrg.

### Inactivity Threshold

Any builder that becomes inactive (does not pass a proposal for 90 days) is deactivated.

* Removed from all internal spaces
* Retains all accumulated Rep and Tokens
* Loses all accumulated Rep while deactivated
* Can reactivate and regain former Rep at any time by passing a proposal

### Rep Slashing

In exceptional circumstances, the DAO may pass a proposal to deactivate an builder if they...

* Request to be removed
* Violate any legal agreements or [dOrg's Code of Ethics](../governance/code-of-ethics.md)
